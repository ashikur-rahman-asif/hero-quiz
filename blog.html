                    <p class="mt-2">In web development, there are several ways to store data locally on the client-side,
                        such as using Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies. Each of these methods has its own
                        unique features and use cases.</p>

                        =><span class="text-lg">Local Storage</span> is a way to store key-value pairs in the browser,
                        which persists even after the browser is closed. The data stored in Local Storage is available
                        across all tabs and windows of the same origin. It provides a larger storage limit than Cookies,
                        usually up to 5-10 MB. Local Storage data can be accessed using the localStorage object in
                        JavaScript.

                        or navigates away from the current website, the data is cleared. Session Storage data can also
                        be accessed using the sessionStorage object in JavaScript.

                        preferences, and tracking user behavior. Cookies can be set with an expiration time, after which
                        they will be automatically deleted. Cookies can be accessed using the document.cookie property
                        in JavaScript.

                    <article class="mt-2">
                        In JavaScript, the Event Loop is a mechanism for managing the execution of asynchronous code. It
                        is responsible for handling the queue of tasks and events that need to be executed, and ensuring
                        that they are executed in the correct order. <br>

                        The Event Loop works as follows: <br>

                        1.When the browser encounters an asynchronous operation, such as a timer, an HTTP request, or a
                        user input event, it is added to a queue of pending tasks. <br>

                        2.The Event Loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty, meaning that all synchronous
                        code
                        has finished executing. If the call stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first task from
                        the queue and add it to the call stack for execution. <br>

                        3.Asynchronous operations that have completed their execution, such as the timer callback, are
                        also added to a separate queue called the callback queue. <br>

                        4.Once the call stack is empty, the Event Loop checks if there are any functions waiting in the
                        callback queue. If so, it will take the first function and add it to the call stack for
                        execution.

                        this function is to start a countdown timer when the user begins a quiz and to end the quiz when
                        the time runs out.
